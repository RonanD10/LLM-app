Question,Answer
How do I edit a page?,"Editing most Wikipedia pages is easy, simply click the ""Edit"" tab at the top of a Wikipedia page (or on a section-edit link). This will take you to a new page with a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing. In this box, you can type in the text that you want to add using wiki markup to format text and add other elements like images and tables. If you don't want to learn the wiki markup syntax, you can enable the VisualEditor (but you must be registered), which allows you to edit pages in a user-friendly way. When you have finished editing, you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes."
How do I create a new page?,"    You are required to have a Wikipedia account to create a new article—you can register here.
    For creating a new article, see Help:Your first article and Wikipedia:Article development; and you may wish to try the Article wizard. For creating a new page in your userspace, see How do I create a user subpage?; or use the Article wizard, which has an option for that. Make sure that it is backed up by reliable sources and it is notable."
Why was my article deleted?,"If you look at the address where your page was, it should have a red box above it that shows the user who deleted it (in the form ""Username ( talk | contribs)"") and their reason (which appears in italics). If the reason is not helpful, or you disagree with it, you can click on the ""talk"" link to send them a message and ask."
How do I change the name of an article?,"    You can move the article using the ""move"" button (you can see it by clicking the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the ""edit"" button). In order to do this, you must have an account that has reached autoconfirmed status, meaning it must be at least four days old and have made at least ten edits. If you are not an autoconfirmed user, the move is controversial, or the page you wish to rename is move-protected, visit Wikipedia:Requested moves. You may also request to have an admin grant you confirmed status if you are a legitimate alternative account of an autoconfirmed user.
"
How do I change my username/delete my account?,"To change your username, see Wikipedia:Changing username.  An account cannot be deleted. If an account was deleted, the edits made by the user could not be properly attributed. You can, however, courtesy vanish, and request that your userpage be deleted by adding the code {{db-user}} to the top of the page."
How do I cite Wikipedia?,See Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia for details.
Who writes the articles on Wikipedia?,"    If your purpose is to cite Wikipedia, see the question above.
    Almost all articles on Wikipedia are written by multiple editors, not just one. If you click on the ""View history"" tab at the top of an article, a list will be displayed of all the contributors to the article and when their contribution(s) was made. A more comprehensive history can be accessed in the ""Page statistics"" which can be found in the External tools of the ""View history"" tab. See Who writes Wikipedia for further details."
"Can I rely on Wikipedia for advice on medical, legal, financial, safety, and other critical issues?","In a word, no. If you need specific advice (for example, medical, legal, financial or risk management), please seek a professional who is licensed or knowledgeable in that area. Wikipedia cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. The content of any given article may recently have been changed, vandalized or altered by someone whose opinion does not correspond with the state of knowledge in the relevant fields. See Wikipedia:General disclaimer for more cautionary information."
What is Wikipedia?,"Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia that you can edit and contribute to. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."" Wikipedia exists to bring knowledge to everyone who seeks it."
Who owns Wikipedia?,"    Wikipedia's tech framework is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which also supports Wikipedia's sister projects, including Wiktionary, Wikibooks, and others, and owns all of their domain names. Previously, the site was hosted on the servers of Bomis, a company mostly owned by Jimmy Wales. With the announcement of the Wikimedia Foundation on June 20, 2003, the ownership of all domain names was transferred to the Foundation. The site is run by the community of Wikipedians guided by the five pillars.

    The articles hosted on this site have been edited by many people, each of whom has (by editing the article) agreed to release their contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. As such, the articles are free content and may be reproduced freely under this license. See Wikipedia:Copyrights and Wikipedia:Readers' FAQ for information on how you can use Wikipedia content.

    By law, contributions are still owned by the people who donated them. These people are not bound by the license and can use their property in the way they like. However, media with multiple authors require permission from every contributor to use them differently from the terms of the Wikipedia license."
Who is responsible for the articles on Wikipedia?,"    You are! Editing is a collaborative effort. Millions of people have contributed information to this project, and anyone can do so, including you. All you need is to know how to edit a page, and have some encyclopedic knowledge that you would like to share. The encyclopedia provides users with a certain amount of freedom.

    You can learn who is responsible for the most recent versions of any given page by clicking on the ""View history"" link. If you spot an error in the latest revision of an article, you are highly encouraged to be bold and correct it. This practice is one of the basic review mechanisms that maintains the reliability of the encyclopedia. As a result, Wikipedia has become one of the most extensive information libraries available on the Internet.

    If you are uncertain, or find the wording confusing, quote the material on the associated talk page and leave a question for the next person. This helps reduce errors, inaccuracies, or misleading wording more quickly and is highly appreciated by the community."
How can I contact the project?,"    See Wikipedia:Contact us for important links and e-mail addresses.
    Given the massively collaborative nature of the project, there is no single point of contact. If you send an e-mail to an individual board or staff member, they will likely just forward it to the group of Wikipedia volunteers who answer reader inquiries. You can reach those volunteers yourself, by e-mailing info-en@wikimedia.org.
    Alternatively, if you wish to suggest improvements to a specific article, you can do so via its talk page. Use the talk tab at the top of each article to get to its talk page."
Should I create an account? Can't I just edit articles anonymously?,"    Editors with user names enjoy several benefits. Among them is the positive reputation that goes with quality work. Wikipedians with an established history are respected especially with regard to neutralizing article disputes. In addition, Wikipedians sometimes find collaborating with unregistered users frustrating, because it is more difficult to contact them with questions, concerns, or suggestions. This is not to say there is a Wikipedia hierarchy per se. Although there are editors with administrative abilities (see Wikipedia:Administrators), these are approved by the community.

    Wikipedians with user names are more anonymous than contributors that do not log in. While anyone can see the IP address of a user who did not log in when they edited, only a few especially trusted people, checkusers, are able to view the IP address of a logged-in user, and this is rarely done. If you are concerned about privacy and anonymity, you may prefer to create a user name for yourself in order to hide your IP address.

    But editing as an unregistered user is acceptable. Many valuable contributors have made this choice. That said, you will not be able to create or rename pages without a user name. Some pages are also protected from editing by unregistered users in order to prevent vandalism."
How do you know if information is correct?,"Given that anyone can edit any article, it is, of course, possible for biased, out-of-date, or incorrect information to be posted. However, because there are so many people reading the articles and monitoring contributions, incorrect information is usually corrected quickly. The overall accuracy of the encyclopedia is improving all the time. You are encouraged to help by correcting articles, validating content, and providing useful references."
How do you prevent people from ruining articles?,"    All changes to a page are registered in a ""page history"", so any defacement can be replaced by an older version of the page by reverting it. And, in general, recent changes to Wikipedia are automatically listed on a special page for that purpose.

    Some bots automatically reverse obvious defacement immediately. Moreover, there are hundreds of people who spend a little time each day watching the list of recent changes on Wikipedia (see Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol). Any user interested in a particular page can add it to a personal watchlist, which shows when a page is updated and gives the user a chance to check that update. Readers who pass by can correct vandalism or erroneous information.

    The popular pages, which are the most likely to be defaced, are also those that receive the most attention from editors and readers.

    To stem a recurrent problem, an article can be temporarily protected from editing and/or user names and IP addresses can be blocked from editing."
Which wiki software does Wikipedia run on?,"    Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects use the MediaWiki software to facilitate collaborative editing and storage of page histories.

    For more information on MediaWiki, see:

        the MediaWiki article, and
        the MediaWiki web site."
How big is Wikipedia?,"    Wikipedia currently has 6,898,961 articles in total in the English version alone.

    In a past comparison of encyclopedias, Wikipedia had about 1,400,000 articles with 340 million words in total, the Encyclopædia Britannica had about 85,000 articles with 55 million words in total, and Microsoft's Encarta had about 63,000 articles and 40 million words in total."
Is Wikipedia accurate and reliable?,"    The reliability of Wikipedia articles is limited by the external sources on which articles rely on, as well as by the ability of Wikipedia's editors to understand those sources correctly and their willingness to use them properly. Therefore, articles may or may not be reliable, and readers should always use their own judgment. Students should never use information in Wikipedia (or any other online encyclopedia) for formal purposes (such as school essays) until they have verified and evaluated the information based on external sources. For this reason, Wikipedia, like any encyclopedia, is a great starting place for research but not always a great ending place.

    Wikipedia is rapidly developing, and its editors strive, over time, to increase its reliability as a source of information. Readers are encouraged to compare articles to what they already know from reliable sources and improve the articles' accuracy and detail. Because of its growing utility, Wikipedia is cited almost daily in the press.

    It is possible for a given Wikipedia article to be biased, outdated, or factually incorrect. This is true of any resource. One should always double-check the accuracy of important facts, regardless of the source. In general, popular Wikipedia articles are more accurate than ones that receive little traffic, because they are read more often and therefore any errors are corrected in a more timely fashion. Wikipedia articles may also suffer from issues such as Western bias, but hopefully this will also improve with time."
Can students cite Wikipedia in assignments?,"    It depends on what teachers accept. Wikipedia can be an excellent starting place for further research. Teachers might ask students what they did to validate the information they learned from Wikipedia. Using a comprehensive search engine, students can compare Wikipedia content with information from other reputable websites. Most Wikipedia articles also contain an ""External links"" section at the bottom, which often leads to other relevant sites. Students can compare information in Wikipedia with information in other encyclopedias or books. As a general rule, contributors to Wikipedia are encouraged to cite their sources, but, of course, not all do. For the sake of verifiability, it is advisable to cite an article that has listed its sources. Most of our better articles have sections such as ""References"", ""Sources"", ""Notes"", ""Further reading"", or ""External links"", which generally contain such information.

    For purposes of establishing authorship and finding more sources, students may also find the articles' ""View history"" tabs useful, as these detail every contribution, the contributor and often a summary of what was contributed. All of our contributors have user talk pages for leaving them messages. If you are logged in, a toolbox link (""E-mail this user"") is also visible beside the user pages of many registered contributors. Other means of contacting Wikipedians are listed at Wikipedia:Contact us."
What software is used to run Wikipedia?,"    Wikipedia currently runs on MediaWiki, created by Lee Daniel Crocker and written in PHP 7. We adopted this software in July 2002. Wikipedia originally ran on UseModWiki, a general wiki script by Clifford Adams written in Perl. In January 2002, we switched to the Phase II software written by Magnus Manske in PHP.

        database backend: MariaDB
        frontend and caching: ATS and Varnish
        application server: Apache
        domain-name service: gdnsd
        Search: Lucene-based ElasticSearch

    See Special:Version for software versions. The Wikipedia servers' operating system is Linux, using the Debian distribution. Previously, Ubuntu was used. For details, see Wikimedia servers."
How big is the database?,"    As of 2012, the combined size of the databases being backed up was between 4 and 6 TB for the copies of the Primary database, and perhaps 27 TB for the images and media (based on wikitech:Backup procedures).

    Early in Wikipedia's history, in February 2003 the database was about 4 GB in size. By April 2004, it was growing at about 1 to 1.4 GB per week, and by October 2004, it had grown to about 170 GB.

    Uploaded files took up approximately 372 gigabytes lc, excluding thumbnails.

    For current information, see wikitech:Backup procedures.

    Compressed database dumps can be downloaded at https://dumps.wikimedia.org/"
Is it possible to download the contents of Wikipedia?,"    Yes, the complete text and editing history of all Wikipedia pages can be downloaded. See Wikipedia:Database download.

    Note that downloading the database dumps is much preferred over trying to spider the entire site. Spidering the site will take you much longer, and puts a lot of load on the server (especially if you ignore our robots.txt and spider over billions of combinations of diffs and whatnot). Heavy spidering can lead to your spider, or your IP, being barred with prejudice from access to the site. Legitimate spiders (for instance search engine indexers) are encouraged to wait about a minute between requests, follow the robots.txt, and if possible only work during less loaded hours (2:00–14:00 UTC is the lighter half of the day).

    The uploaded images and other media files are not currently bundled in an easily downloadable form; if you need one, please contact the developers on the wikitech-l mailing list. Please do not spider the whole site to get images."
