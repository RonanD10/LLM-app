Q & A interface where you can ask questions about a company (Wikipedia, for demonstration).

The app is trained on the Wikipedia FAQs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ), and can answer about using Wikipedia as a reader or editor and about Wikipedia's design and history. 

Example questions: 

- What stack does Wikipedia run on?
- How do I edit an article?
- Who co-founded Wikipedia?
- Is Wikipedia a reliable source?
